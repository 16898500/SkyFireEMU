Coding and Pull Requests
-----------

* We generally follow the Sun/Oracle coding standards.
* No tabs; use 4 spaces instead.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* No CRLF line endings, LF only, put your gits 'core.autocrlf' on 'true'.
* No 80 column limit or 'weird' midstatement newlines.
* The number of commits in a pull request should be kept to a minimum (squish them into one most of the time - use common sense!).
* No merges should be included in pull requests unless the pull request's purpose is a merge.
* Pull requests should be tested (does it compile? AND does it work?) before submission.
* Any major additions should have documentation ready and provided if applicable (this is usually the case).
* Try to follow test driven development where applicable.
